      Hello!

      I am a student from Tokyo, Japan attending Carnegie Mellon University.
  
      My journey as a student at such an interdisciplinary, research-oriented institution has not only provided me with a strong foundation in artistic expression, but has also informed me of the immense impact of technology on our daily lives and its influence on the way we create and interact with the world.
        
      Therefore, my work is guided by my exploration of the intersections between art, design, computer science, and technology. 
      From the canvas to the circuit board, Iâ€™ve taken every opportunity to produce a multimodal series of work. Whether it be malleable textiles knit using yarn and installed across walls, to lines of code written that program user-interactive animated drawings and the activation of LEDs, my work harnesses the synergy between art and technology.
